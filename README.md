# SerengetiDataLab

An E2E solution of the Data Resources on Azure using the Snapshot Serengeti dataset. This E2E solution focuses Azure Synapse Analytics, Microsoft Purview, Power Bi & the Azure Data Factory. 

# Azure Resources
This lab leverages the following Azure resources:

### Microsoft Purvew
Purview is a data governance and catalog service that allows discorvering, classifyong and understanding data. We'll use the snapshot serengeti dayaset to sow how Purview can be used to discover and classify data--

### Azure Synapse Analytics
Synapse is a cloud-based data integration, analytics, and machine learning service. It can be used to create a data pipeline that ingests the Serengeti dataset from Azure storage, transforms the data as needed, and loads it into a Synapse workspace.

### Power BI: 
Power BI is a business intelligence and data visualization tool. It can be used to create dashboards and reports based on the Serengeti dataset, allowing exploration and analysis of the data in different ways.

### Azure Data Factory: 
Data Factory is a cloud-based data integration service that allows creating, scheduling, and orchestrating data pipelines. It can be used to automate the process of moving the Serengeti dataset from Azure storage to Synapse and to schedule data transformation and loading jobs.

### Azure ML
Azure ML is a cloud-based machine learning platform that allows developing, training, and deploying machine learning models. It can be used to build an AI model that can predict and classify the animals present in the Serengeti camera trap images.

### Azure Storage
Azure Storage is a cloud-based storage service that allows storing and retrieving large amounts of data. It can be used to store the Serengeti dataset, as well as the output of the data pipelines created in Data Factory.

### Azure SQL
Azure SQL is a cloud-based relational database service. It can be used to store the results of the AI model developed in Azure ML, as well as any other data that needs to be stored in a structured format.

### Apache Spark
Apache Spark is an open-source distributed processing engine that can be used to process large amounts of data in parallel. It can be used to perform data transformations and processing on the Serengeti dataset within Synapse, allowing scaling up data processing and analysis tasks.
